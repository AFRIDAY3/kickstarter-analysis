# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
###### The purpose of the analysis was to compare campaign outcomes for various campaigns. We can visualize the outcomes based on launch dates and funding goals. With this information we can provide options to choose the best campaigns to be funded. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
###### I viewed trends of outcomes success rates based on their launch dates. Line chart “Outcome Based on Launch date.png” shows the different outcomes and the times of the year they tend to occur. One of the most common campaigns were Theater campaigns as displayed in the chart “Theater_ Outcome_vs_Launch.png”. The theater category is another significant factor to consider as it may be a profitable type of campaign to take on based on the trends. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
###### Fundraising goal amounts and the campaigns were compared by plotting the percentages of the failed, successful and canceled campaigns. With the Outcomes_vs_Goals.png I was able to visualize the results of the campaigns based on the goal amounts achieved in total. I created figures “Parent Category Outcomes Chart.png” and “Subcategory Outcomes Chart.png” that displayed the results of each campaign. Categories are an important factor in this analysis as it displayed what specific types of campaigns are more like to produce successful outcomes. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
###### Some factors that may have been missed in this analysis are viewing trends on how many backs each parent category had, comparisons between pledged vs goal amounts, or funding timeframes of different campaigns. There is no data on who the backers/donors are, and that could be helpful in deciding which types of campaigns to fundraise and where these campaigns can occur and have successful outcomes.  

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
 - There are roughly 25% more successful theater outcomes than failed outcomes. The theater category displayed the most successful outcomes between May and June. This data is displayed in the figure “Theater_ Outcome_vs_Launch.png”.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  - Majority of the campaigns had a goal amount between $1,000-$4,999; at this range held the greatest number of successful outcomes. However, the highest percentage of successful outcomes fell between the $0-$1,000 goal amount. Over 20% of campaigns canceled had a goal amount of over $45,000. Campaigns that reach a goal of over $45,000 showed a trend of failure.  Goals amounts that ranged between $40,000 and $44,999 showed the greatest variation of outcomes, as displayed in the “Outcome Based on Launch date.png” chart.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  - The data is very broad and could be narrow down by successful outcomes, country, or parent categories. The names of the backers could also be included in the dataset to display donors that gave the highest and can compare how much donors give, and how it affects the success rate of funding campaigns. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  - A graph comparing goal amounts vs outcomes for each category or subcategory to visualize popularity of campaigns or what types of campaigns that are cost-effective.
